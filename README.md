# Hello!
My name is Amanda Dahl and I am in the Product community of practice at USDS.
Before joining USDS, I was at PlayStation making better ways for
developers to publish and promote their games. 

<p>I was born and raised in
California, but spent many years living in the UK, where I had the great
fortune to work at the BBC on things like Doctor Who, the BBC Homepage and
BBC News. It instilled a public service spirit in me that I bring to the USDS. 
  
<p>I’ve
worked in many industries, from bioinformatics to finance to media, but a
major thread running through all that I do has been simplification, ease of use
and helping users to get the job done with a minimum of fuss. 

<p>I’m a believer in
user centered design, design thinking and first principles thinking and some of my favorite topics in Product include:<br>
-Strategy & Vision <br>
-Product Operations <br>
-Product planning, roadmapping & prioritization


Outside
work, my favorite podcasts usually have to do with humane technology and
effective altruism. I enjoy travel, long form drama, skiing, all things cheese, comedy and spending time
with my young family.
